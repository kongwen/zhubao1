    Text is probably used in most things we build.
    Larger text masses might be better added through
    normal HTML,because of accessibility and such.
    Other texts could be just  part of your app and
    doesn't necessarily need to be accessible
    in the same way. For those purposes,oCanvas
    includes a text display object. It is very easy
    to use, and works with fonts the way CSS does.
    If you want a special font, you can include
    the @font-face declarations in your CSS code,
    and the font will be available for use in the text
    objects, just as it would in a normal HTML context.</div>
